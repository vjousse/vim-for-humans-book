So here we go, we now have everything needed to make a good start with |vim|. It should be enough to use it on a daily basis. It's the most important thing to do if you want to successfully use |vim|: developing the habit of using it everyday. Once you'll have this habit, everything should seem natural to you.

The aim of this chapter is to provide you with a reference for the most common things you'll have to do with |vim| so that, when you are lost, you know where to search for help. This chapter contains two parts. The first one is a set of Q/A covering the most common problems that beginners face. The goal is to answer the question of "f**k, how can I do this, it was so simple with my old editor". The second is a non-exhaustive list of the most useful |vim| commands.

Questions / Answers
===================

How do I  quit |vim|?
---------------------

First you need to be in normal mode. If you don't know if you are in normal mode, just press |ttesc| or |ttsemicolon| (depending on your configuration) multiple times. This should bring you to normal mode. Then, type ``:q`` to exit |vim|. The problem is that most of the time, |vim| will not let you quit immediately. For example, if you have unsaved changes, |vim|  will not let you quit. You can cancel your modifications by using ``!`` like this: ``:q!``. You can also save your modifications and save like this: ``:wq``.

How do I "save as"?
-------------------

In normal mode, if you type ``:w``, |vim| will by default save your modifications into the current file. If you want to use another filename to "save as", you just need to specify it after ``w`` like this: ``:w myfile.txt``. |vim| will save your file under the name *myfile.txt*. However, be aware that |vim| will not open *myfile.txt*, it will stay on the previous file.

If you want |vim| to save under the filename *myfile.txt* and then open the file in the current buffer, you will have to use ``:sav myfile.txt``.

How do I copy/cut and paste?
----------------------------

This one is easy, and there is already a full chapter on it: :ref:`moving`.

In short:

* Switch to visual mode with |ttv|,
* Select the text you want to copy by moving the cursor,
* Copy using |tty| or cut using |ttx| or |ttd|,
* Paste after the cursor using |ttp| or before using |ttP|.

How do I create a new file?
---------------------------


The traditional way to create a file is to type, in normal mode, ``:e myfile.txt`` to open an empty buffer. Then, save your buffer using ``:w``. Il will be saved as ``myfile.txt`` in the current directory.

You can also use Lusty Explorer (cf. :ref:`seclusty`). To do so, launch it using ``,lr`` or ``,lf`` (supposing that your leader key is ``,``), type the name of the file you want to create and then press |ttctrl| and |tte| at the same time. You can then save as above.

How do I undo/redo?
-------------------

To undo, just press |ttu| while in normal mode. To undo your undo (and so, to redo) press |ttctrl| and |ttr| at the same time.
