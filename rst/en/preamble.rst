Paid book but free price
------------------------

What does it mean? I am convinced that culture and education should be accessible for everyone. Asking people to pay a price fixed in advance would put a barrier that limits the access to the book. That's why I let you choose your price.

And what if you don't have any money to give in exchange for this book? Well, just download it freely and make the promise you will use it for the best. Talk about it, share it and enjoy!

Whatever you give, it will be a motivation for me to write more books like this one.

If you give in money, 20% of the earnings are donated to Framasoft, an association promoting free software.

You can give on the official website http://vimebook.com/en

Thanks for listening, and have fun!

Free license

I'm releasing the book under the `Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Internationa lLicence  <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_. So, you can do (almost) whatever you want with this ebook.
